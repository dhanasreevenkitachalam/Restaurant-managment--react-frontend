	This a single Page Web application that allows users to view  dishes of that restaurant and 
	view promotions and know more about the leaders. Once signedin, the user can add  favorite,write comments
	and view the favorites and delete them.

## Why?

	This frontend application was part of Full stack react specialization using coursera.

## Role 

	The entire Frontend course consists of 4 modules. Each module consists of 1 week of study.
	At the end of each week, we have to submit the assignment based on the topic covered in that particular week
                    Each assignment consists of  3 or 4 tasks to be completed that were part of restaurant Frontend Application.
	Once an assignment is submitted , it is reviewed by peers and graded by the review criteria.
	We have to get a grade of 80% or above to move on to next module.
